=head1 NAME

B<julian> - convert Julian dates to & from calendar dates

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<julian> [B<-O> | B<-o>] [B<-q>] [I<date> ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When not passed any arguments on the command line, B<julian> outputs the
current Julian date (the number of days since 4713 BC Jan 1) and exits.

When passed one or more arguments, B<julian> converts each calendar date on the
command line to a Julian date & each Julian date to a calendar date and outputs
the results in order.

Julian dates are read & output as base-10 numbers with optional fractional
parts.

Calendar dates are read & output in a subset of ISO 8601 format: a
C<YYYY-MM-DD> string (with an optional C<+> or C<-> prepended to the year)
specifying a date, optionally followed by C<T> and a C<hh:mm:ss> string
specifying a time.  A year value of 0 corresponds to 1 BC, a year value of -1
corresponds to 2 BC, and so forth.

This program uses 1582 Oct 5/15 (JD 2299161) as the date of the Gregorian
Reformation when handling calendar dates.  All dates before this point use the
Julian calendar, and all dates after use the Gregorian.  An input date in the
range 1582 Oct 5-14 is assumed to still be on the Julian calendar.

of the Gregorian reforms in 1752 will have the corresponding "Old Style"
