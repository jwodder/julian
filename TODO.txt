- Add automated testing of O.S. date output
- Test more negative Julian dates

- Handle all of the sections marked "TODO" in the code
- Add a switch for setting the precision of Julian date output
- Add an option for setting the date of the Reformation (affecting input or
  just output?)
- Make dates beginning with minus signs be recognized as such rather than as
  invalid options
- If an error message is printed, the exit status should be nonzero.
- Get rid of `-q` and have "old-value = " fields only be output when a `-v`
  option is given
- Represent seconds as floats?
- Add an option for printing calendar dates as YYYY-DDD, the latter part being
  the yday, starting at 001
- Implement input & output of proleptic Gregorian dates (ISO 8601 seems to
  require using them...)

- Mention rounding errors and truncation of Julian values to four places after
  the decimal point in a "RESTRICTIONS" section in the manpage
