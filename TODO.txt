- Add automated testing of O.S. date output
- Test more negative Julian dates

- Handle all of the sections marked "TODO" in the code

  just output?)
- Make dates beginning with minus signs be recognized as such rather than as
  invalid options
- If an error message is printed, the exit status should be nonzero.
- Represent seconds as floats?
- Add an option for printing calendar dates as YYYY-DDD, the latter part being
  the yday, starting at 001
- Implement input & output of proleptic Gregorian dates (ISO 8601 seems to
  require using them...)
