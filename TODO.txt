- Add automated testing of O.S. date output
- Test more negative Julian dates
- Add automated testing of YYYY-DDD input & output?

- Add a README
- Handle all of the sections marked "TODO" in the code
- Add an option for setting the date of the Reformation (affecting input or
  just output?)
- Add a way to set the stopping point for `-o` O.S. dates
- Implement input & output of proleptic Gregorian dates
- Add an option for converting between the Julian & Gregorian calendars?
- Add an option for printing the input date but not the converted date; when
  combined with `-j` (or lack thereof) and options for dealing with proleptic
  Gregorian calendars, this can be used to convert between calendars and
  calendar date representations
- Add a way to input & output Julian dates as integer dates with an integer
  number of seconds?  (e.g., 2456818:50881 as a less roundoff-error-prone
  alternative to 2456818.5889)
- Add an `-h` (help) flag?
- Reject input of any calendar dates that have Julian dates outside an int's
  range
- Should `printJulian()` omit trailing zeroes from the fractional parts of JDs?

- Add a note to the manpage about Julian days starting at noon and the
  potential pitfalls resulting from this
- Address timezone issues somewhere in the manpage?
- Add a license notice to the manpage?
- Add a note about the allowed range of input values to the manpage?
