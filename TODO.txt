- Add automated testing of O.S. date output
- Test more negative Julian dates
- Add automated testing of YYYY-DDD input & output?

- Handle all of the sections marked "TODO" in the code
- Add a switch for setting the precision of Julian date output
- Add an option for setting the date of the Reformation (affecting input or
  just output?)
- Add a way to set the stopping point for `-o` O.S. dates
- Make dates beginning with minus signs be recognized as such rather than as
  invalid options
- Represent seconds as floats?
- Implement input & output of proleptic Gregorian dates (ISO 8601 seems to
  require using them...)
- Add an option for converting between the Julian & Gregorian calendars?
- Add an option for printing the input date but not the converted date; when
  combined with `-j` (or lack thereof) and options for dealing with proleptic
  Gregorian calendars, this can be used to convert between calendars and
  calendar date representations
- Should the `-o` and `-O` options affect echoing of the input date with `-v`
  as well?  If not, this should be pointed out in the manpage.
- Detect out-of-range mdays in input

- Address timezone issues somewhere in the manpage?
- Link to the GitHub repository somewhere in the manpage
